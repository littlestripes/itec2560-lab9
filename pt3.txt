When comparing the two side-by-side, what immediately jumps out to me is how
much cleaner and more readable the same app's code is in Vue. It's easier to
follow the flow of data and understand what does what; data's "duties" are
clearly delineated. Vue's more advanced methods of dealing with the DOM are
made clear when you consider how much boilerplate is involved in vanilla JS.
Categorizing data into refs and computed properties and keeping in mind the
principle of reactivity helps the developer passively write better code
without contributing mental overhead.

I strongly prefer the Vue approach. I find that its readability and elegance
make it a joy to use and its developer ecosystem provides for a very
comfortable experience. Instead of fighting with vanilla JavaScript's opaque
errors, I'm able to see all of the objects I'll be working with at a glance
and know immediately what's wrong and where.
